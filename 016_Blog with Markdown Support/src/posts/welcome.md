# Welcome to My Blog

This is the first post on our new blog! We're using:

- **Next.js** for the framework
- **Markdown** for content
- **TypeScript** for type safety

## Features

- File-based routing
- Static generation
- Easy content management with Markdown

```javascript
// Example code block
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`
}
