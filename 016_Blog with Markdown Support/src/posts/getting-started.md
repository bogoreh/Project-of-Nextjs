# Getting Started with Next.js

Next.js is a React framework that enables server-side rendering and static site generation.

## Key Features

1. **File-based Routing**: Create routes by adding files to the pages directory
2. **API Routes**: Build API endpoints alongside your pages
3. **Static Generation**: Pre-render pages at build time
4. **Server-side Rendering**: Render pages on each request

## Installation

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-app
cd my-app
npm run dev
